%this script calculates the efficiency curves of the drive train over it's entire acceleration-speed domain
%is one step up in complexity from "MotorEfficiencyPlot" as it includes
%losses from the drive train in the calc
%including gear ratio will make efficiency a function of 3 variables which will be hard to
%visualize
%will have to run an optimization at each time point
